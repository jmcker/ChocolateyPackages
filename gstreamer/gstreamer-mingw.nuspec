    <summary>A pipeline-based multimedia framework for recording, streaming, and editing.</summary>
    <description>
GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

GStreamer is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Versioning is done in the `MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO` format with even `MINOR` numbers indicating stable releases, and odd `MINOR` numbers indicating unstable development releases [[source](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-docs/blob/master/markdown/frequently-asked-questions/developing.md#what-kind-of-versioning-scheme-does-gstreamer-use)].

This package performs a "Complete" install and may contain restricted codecs or protocols with additional licensing restrictions or potential patent issues in some countries.
